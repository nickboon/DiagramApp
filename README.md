# DiagramApp

This code was based on that a spinning cube tutorial by Keith Peters and Billy Lamberta. I'm using a modified version of their colorToRGB method. I reccomend the book:

The general idea is to build solids from primitives and add them to a stage, which can then be animated. The movements of the solids on the stage are controlled by a transformer.

See the test.html and testApp.js file for an example.
